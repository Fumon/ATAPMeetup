# As Toy As Possible Meetup.com clone

This project demonstrates the *least* feature complete version of a Meetup.com clone. It's goals (in order of importance) are to be written in under 30 minutes, show app design principles, and hopefully resemble some of the recognizable features of its target app.

# Running

Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Fumon/ATAP-Meetup.git
```

Install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

Start the server

```sh
$ node app.js
```

The app runs on port 9000. If running on a local machine, you can click this link http://localhost:9000
